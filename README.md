[Work In Progress...]

In this project, we utilize the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by Pinecone to enhance interactions with the ChatGPT chatbot by providing it with context from an entire codebase. Instead of users having to post snippets of code, the chatbot will be knowledgeable about the entire codebase, making it an invaluable tool for developers seeking to understand or debug their code.

RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based models and generative models. Traditional chatbots can sometimes struggle to maintain up-to-date information or access domain-specific knowledge. This solution uses a knowledge base created from a locally crawled codebase, ensuring relevant and accurate responses.

Integrating Vercel's AI SDK into our setup streamlines the chatbot workflow and optimizes streaming, especially in edge environments. This further enhances the responsiveness and efficiency of our chatbot. The outcome is a chatbot that offers context-aware responses without any hallucinations, thereby ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Next.js Application

Next.js is a robust JavaScript framework that facilitates the creation of server-side rendered and static web applications using React. Given its ease of setup, outstanding performance, and in-built features such as routing and API routes, it's an ideal choice for our application.

To initiate a new Next.js app:

### npx

```bash
npx create-next-app codebase-assistant
```

Next, we'll add the `ai` package:

```bash
npm install ai
```

You can use the [full list](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-vercel-example/blob/main/package.json) of dependencies if you'd like to build along with the tutorial.

## Step 2: Create the Chatbot

This section will guide you through integrating the Vercel SDK to set up the backend and frontend of our chatbot within the Next.js application. At the end of this step, you'll have a basic chatbot ready for the addition of context-aware capabilities.

### Chatbot Frontend Component
This part focuses on the frontend component of our chatbot, building the user-facing elements. This involves creating an interface within our Next.js application through which users will engage with our tool.

### Chatbot API Endpoint
Next, let's set up the chatbot's API endpoint. This server-side component handles the requests and responses for our chatbot. The setup involves creating a new file named api/chat/route.ts and incorporating specific dependencies.

## Step 3: Incorporating Context
A significant aspect of building our chatbot is understanding and implementing context. Context ensures that the chatbot's responses are coherent and relevant. Without it, responses can appear disjointed or unrelated. Recognizing the context of a user's query allows our chatbot to deliver precise, relevant, and engaging responses.

This step is primarily about feeding our chatbot the necessary information and establishing the infrastructure for its retrieval and effective utilization.

### Seeding the Knowledge Base
In this stage, instead of URLs, we'll be focusing on local codebases. The aim is to seed the knowledge base by crawling a local codebase, its root directory, and all its subdirectories. This will allow the chatbot to have knowledge about the entire codebase, making interactions more informed and context-rich.

## Running Tests
The project uses Jest and Playwright for end-to-end testing.
